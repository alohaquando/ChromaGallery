		This ball sports a distinctive stripe pattern that results from an innovative manufacturing
		process. Plastic of two colours is blown into a mould using a method that prevents the colours
		from mixing. The ball is a by-product of a demonstration of the extrusion blow-mould machine
		invented by the Hong Kong engineer Chiang Chen. The development of the two-colour production
		technique is often attributed to Chiang as well. This process was inspired by his recollection
		of the confluence of the Yangtze River and its tributary, the Jialing, in mainland China: one
		was muddy and the other clear, but the two currents remained distinct rather than blending
		together. Despite the success of his manufacturing method, Chiang was never able to file a
		patent for it, and it was soon widely imitated to create other types of products.
